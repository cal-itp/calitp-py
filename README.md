# calitp-py

This repository contains three libraries.

* calitp-data - core, shared configuration and auth code
* calitp-data-analysis - library for querying data in notebook
* calitp-data-infra - library for data pipelines

Each package has its own poetry environment and CI tests. They are published
individually to pypi right now.
